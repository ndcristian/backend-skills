The Functional Programing is a way of building software by using pure functions and by avoiding shared state , mutation & side-effects

shared state = a variable being accessed by more than one function
side-effects = function modifies the variable

Key Concepts:

*Pure function = that means a function witch return a predictable output no meter what
*Function as first class object
*Higher-order functions
