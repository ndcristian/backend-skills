- **Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with the objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
- that requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as objects of your superclasses
- child classes should never break the parent class type definition

EX:

public class Vehicle {}
public class Car extends Vehicle {}

Liskov substitution principle says that we cat call

 run(Vehicle v)
 as wel as
 run(Car c)
 without breaking the application
