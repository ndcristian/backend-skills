** I = Interface Segregation Principle
CLIENTS SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO DEPEND UPON INTERFACES THAT THEY DO NOT USE
that means a class should not be forced to implement methods that it not use

- it is not good if an interface has a large number of methods
- we should separate the methods accordingly
- that because in Java we can implement as many interfaces as we want
- and in Java an interface can extend other interface
