UML = unified Modeling Language
- is not a programing language
- it is a graphical notation
- used to draw diagrams

Association could be either a Aggregation( object can exist without its container -- owner class)
or a Composition ( where an object can not exist outside the wrapper class -- owner class )

Aggregation must have a class container and a class contained

But When we can have only Association????
