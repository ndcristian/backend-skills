Features:

Enqueue: Adding an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removing an element from the front of the queue.
Peek: Retrieve the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
Size: Determining the number of elements in the queue.
Empty Check: Checking if the queue is empty.

Advantages:
FIFO Behavior: Elements are processed in the order of their insertion, ensuring the preservation of the original sequence.
Efficient Insertion and Removal: Adding and removing elements from a queue is fast and has a constant time complexity of O(1).
Synchronization: Java provides synchronized queue implementations, making them safe for concurrent programming.
Standardized Interface: The Queue interface in Java offers a common set of methods, allowing easy interchangeability between different queue implementations.
Disadvantages:

No Random Access: Queues do not support direct Access to elements in the middle. Accessing specific positions requires dequeuing preceding elements.
Limited Size: Some queue implementations have a fixed size or capacity, leading to overflow or exceptions when exceeding the maximum size.
Inefficient Search: Searching for an element in a queue requires dequeuing until a match is found, resulting in a linear search with potentially high time complexity.
