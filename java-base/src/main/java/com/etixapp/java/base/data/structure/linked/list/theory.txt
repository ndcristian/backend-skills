LinkedList vs. ArrayList
    - ArrayList use indexes -- LinkedList noes not
    - ArrayList elements are stored close each other in memory (one after one, contiguous place in memory) --  LinkedList elements are spread into memory

Complexity:
    - add element to the end: O(1)
    - remove element from the end: O(n) - because to set the TAIL pointer to last element we have to loop through entire list of elements and that because
        we can't move backwards to the list LinkedList
    - add element to the beginning: O(1)
    - remove element from the beginning: O(1)
    - inserting a node: O(n)
    - removing a node: O(n)
    - finding an element: O(n)
