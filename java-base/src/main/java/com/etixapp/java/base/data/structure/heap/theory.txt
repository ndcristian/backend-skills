A HEAP is a binary tree, but the numbers are laid out in a different way.

all the children are smaller than its parents

In a HEAP, each node has a value that is greater than each of its descendants, and because of that,
the maximum value is always going to be at the top. This is MAX HEAP

A key characteristic of a HEAP is this tree will always be complete.

So one of the other things that makes a heap different than a binary search tree is that in a heap you
can have duplicates.

But you could also have a MIN HEAP where the minimum value is at the top.

So other than the maximum value being at the top, there is no particular order to the other nodes.
So for example, on the second line we could take these two nodes and switch them.
And this is still a valid heap.
